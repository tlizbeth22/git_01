Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

A neighbor of mine in the village  
Likes to tell how one spring  
When she was a girl on the farm, she did  
A childlike thing.  

One day she asked her father  
To give her a garden plot  
To plant and tend and reap herself,  
And he said, 'Why not?'  

In casting about for a corner  
He thought of an idle bit  
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,  
And he said, 'Just it.'
